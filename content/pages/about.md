Interests
---------

I'm interested in Python, Django and other facets of web development. I like to follow news about InfoSec, hacker culture and online privacy.

When not coding you'll find me playing PC games. Sometimes I go Skiing, although not often enough. Member of the [BHA](https://humanism.org.uk/).

Currently working at [Hogarth](http://www.hogarthww.com/), in Soho.
